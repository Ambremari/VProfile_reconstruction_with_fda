# Reconstruction of Truncated Vertical Profiles using FDA 

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/944441772.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/944441772)

This repository provides the R implementation used in Couteyen Carpaye et al. (in prep) to reconstruct truncated vertical profiles (e.g. temperature, salinity...) with functional data analysis (FDA). This method is based on the principal components analysis through conditional expectation (PACE) described by Yao et al. (2005).

The method is designed for substantial datasets of vertical profiles, that may be irregularly sampled, with some profiles being truncated, or partially missing.

Parts of the implementation are adapted from the R package **fda** (Ramsay, 2024), in compliance with its GPL license.

## Requirements

The following R packages are required:

- `fda`
- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
- `shiny` (optional, for interactive visualisation)
- `bslib`, `shinycssloaders` (optional)

---

## Input data format

Input data must be provided as a data frame with at least the following columns:

| Column name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `INDEX`    | Profile identifier |
| `DEPTH`    | Vertical coordinate |
| `<VAR>`    | Variable to reconstruct (e.g. `TEMPERATURE`, `SALINITY`) |

Each `INDEX` corresponds to one vertical profile, which may be incomplete or irregularly sampled.

---

## Running the reconstruction

The reconstruction pipeline is executed via the script `main.R`.

Before running the script, please ensure that:

- The main branch of this repository is set as your working directory
- Your input data file is correctly specified in the object `sparse_data`
- The name of the variable to reconstruct is defined in `my_var`
- Reconstruction parameters (e.g. smoothing parameter, number of basis functions, number of PCs) are set according to your application


The main steps of the reconstruction are:

1. Identification of complete and incomplete profiles
2. Construction of a functional data object from complete profiles using B-splines
3. FPCA on functional data object
4. Projection of incomplete profiles in the FPCA space with PACE
5. Reconstruction of full vertical profiles
6. Computation of confidence intervals

## Output objects

### `reconstructed_profiles`

`reconstructed_profiles` is a **data frame containing reconstructed vertical profiles for initially incomplete observations**.

Each row corresponds to a reconstructed value at a given depth for a given profile.

#### Structure

| Column name | Description                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `INDEX`     | Profile identifier                                          |
| `DEPTH`     | Depth at which the reconstruction is evaluated              |
| `<VAR>`     | Reconstructed value of the target variable                  |
| `CI_low`    | Lower bound of the pointwise confidence interval            |
| `CI_up`     | Upper bound of the pointwise confidence interval            |
| `CB_low`    | Lower bound of the confidence band                          |
| `CB_up`     | Upper bound of the confidence band                          |
